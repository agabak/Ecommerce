In a modern microservices architecture, separating databases per bounded context (e.g., Orders, Products, Inventory)
is considered best practice for scalability and resilience. Kafka (or any event streaming platform) is often used for 
reliable communication and data synchronization between these services.

High-Level Architecture
Microservices:

Product Service (Product catalog, pricing, product details, images)

Inventory Service (Stock management, warehouse locations, reservations)

Order Service (Order placement, order history, status)

Payment Service (Payment transactions, refunds)

User Service (Authentication, profiles)

Each service has its own database
(e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)

Communication:

REST/gRPC: For direct service-to-service calls (e.g., query product details)

Kafka: For asynchronous event-driven flows (e.g., order placed, inventory update, payment processed)

Example: Workflow for Placing an Order
Order Service receives a new order request (from API/UI).

Order Service emits an OrderCreated event to Kafka.

Inventory Service consumes the OrderCreated event, checks stock, reserves items, updates its own database, and emits InventoryReserved (or InventoryFailed) event.

Order Service consumes InventoryReserved event, updates order status, and emits OrderReadyForPayment event.

Payment Service consumes the event, processes payment, emits PaymentCompleted event.

Order Service receives PaymentCompleted, marks order as completed, triggers shipping, etc.

Sample Service/DB Breakdown
Product Service
Database: Product catalog only

Tables: Products, Categories, ProductImages, etc.

Inventory Service
Database: Only inventory-related data

Tables: Inventory, Warehouses, InventoryTransactions

Order Service
Database: Only order-related data

Tables: Orders, OrderItems, etc.

Payments Service
Database: Only payment data

Tables: Payments, Refunds

Kafka Topics Example
order.created

inventory.reserved

inventory.failed

payment.completed

order.completed

(etc.)

Benefits
Autonomy: Each service can scale independently.

Resilience: Failure in one service doesn’t bring down others.

Flexibility: Each team/service can pick the best database for its needs.

Data Consistency: Event sourcing & CQRS can help with consistency.

Challenges & Best Practices
Eventual Consistency: Data across services is eventually, not instantly, consistent.

Idempotency: Event handlers must be idempotent (safe to process events more than once).

Unique IDs: Use UUIDs/Guids to prevent collision across services.

Transaction Boundaries: No distributed transactions across databases; use the Saga pattern for process coordination.

Data duplication: Sometimes it’s okay to denormalize/copy product info across services (as long as you update via events).

Summary
Yes, you can (and should) separate databases for Orders, Products, Inventory, etc., in a microservices/Kafka system.

Kafka provides reliable, decoupled, scalable event-driven communication.

Each service is responsible for its own data and publishes/subscribes to relevant events.
